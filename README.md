MYST FAQ


>Q: Who developed MYST?
<br>A: MYST was developed by a highly experienced team spanning blockchain development, trading, and AI/ML. Its core members have spent years trialling, refining, and redesigning trading algorithms and developing proprietary trading bots that accommodate a broad range of signals and indicators. Although largely pseudonymous, the MYST team has successfully worked with high profile crypto projects in the past to develop trading bots and establish community DAOs governed by token incentives.

>Q: How do I know that MYST is not a rug?
<br>A: All of the MYST smart contracts, including the MXST token sale contract and the MYST staking contract, are undergoing a third party audit. The MYST team has no ability to steal your funds even if they wanted to. MYST is not a “soft rug” either i.e. a project that raises funds and never ships an MVP before slowly fading away. Due to the design of MYST, the team is compelled to start paying out rewards to stakers from day one of trading. This will provide the proof that MYST is working as intended while giving other potential users the confidence to join the community. The inherent design of MYST, which is reliant on social proof from fellow users receiving their promised payouts, prevents any kind of rug – hard or soft – from being pulled. 

>Q: How do I know that MYST works?
<br>A: The Alpha launch of MYST will demonstrate the bot’s efficacy. While we can provide the results of countless backtests detailing the bot’s ability to operate over different timeframes and market conditions, the only way to prove categorically that it works is to open MYST to the public. When this occurs, the MYST community will be able to see for themselves the sort of returns the bot can generate on a daily basis.

>The success of the Alpha release will in turn attest to the prospects of the Beta release being even more profitable. We don’t need to claim that our bot works: we intend to prove it every single day.

>Q: Does MYST generate a profit with every trade it makes?
<br>A: It is impossible to guarantee a profit any time an entity enters a trade. There are too many exogenous factors beyond their control (macro movements, actions of whales and other traders, news events that can influence market reaction etc). Thus, the MYST bot cannot be guaranteed of profit with every trade.
><br><br>
>Instead, MYST has an edge which ensures that over a reasonable timeframe (i.e. days or weeks), it is capable of generating vastly more successful trades than unsuccessful ones, accruing a net profit.

>Q: What happens if MYST makes more than 1% profit a day?
<br>A: MYST users are guaranteed a payout of up to 1.5% a day for the duration of their stake (usually 28 days). Even if the bot generates more than this, the profit will not be shared with stakers. Instead, any excess profit will be used to create a reserve that will be utilized in the unlikely event of there being a day or days when MYST does not trade profitably. This scenario is not expected to manifest. However, maintaining a liquidity buffer is a sensible course of action, while capping the daily payout at 1.5% maintains realistic user expectations.

>Q: If the bot is so profitable, why are you not keeping it to yourself?
><br>A: As explained in the MYST litepaper, opening the bot to the public benefits all parties. It provides proof of MYST’s effectiveness, which in turn will position the MYST team as leading trading bot developers. This will open the door to many more business opportunities and partnership possibilities. In addition, the funds we can raise from conducting a small MXST token sale will accelerate the rate at which we can implement the MYST roadmap and reduce the time-to-market of the MYST Beta.

>From a purely selfish perspective, it actually benefits the MYST team to open the bot to a limited number of community members. Over and above that, however, we genuinely want to see others benefit from MYST’s capabilities. We believe MYST to be a best-in-class automated trading bot and we welcome the endorsements that will come from seeing this thesis validated in the wild.

>Q: Will you be open sourcing MYST’s code?
<br>A: That’s something we cannot do for obvious reasons. Making MYST’s code available to other developers and traders would essentially mean giving up all revenue streams and jeopardizing future development. We are happy however to open MYST’s benefits to the community, enabling them to benefit from the bot’s capabilities without exposing its inner workings.

>Q: Is your bot for sale?
<br>A: Selling MYST and its proprietary algorithms is not something we are considering or anticipate considering in the future. We intend to retain ownership of our IP and to monetize it in the way we best see fit. Given the amount of time, resources, and energy it has taken to get MYST to this stage, we have no desire to pass it on to a third party for their benefit – for any price.

>Q: Are you working on other products?
<br>A: Yes. While we are not at liberty to disclose these right now, we have a number of products in the works, most of which are designed to complement MYST. Following the launch of the MYST Beta, more information on these products, and how the existing community can access them first, will be released.

>Q: Can I restake my funds after 28 days if I wish to continue using MYST?
<br>A: Yes.

>Q:How do I calculate  my potential earnings?
<br>A: We have built a compound calculator specifically for you and added it to our website, https://MYST.fi . it will also be found on our dashboard so that you can quickly calculate your returns, and decide how much you want to stake.


>Q: What is the MXST token for?
<br>A: The MXST token has an array of utilities. Firstly it is used as a governance token to enable voting for pertinent decisions made for our network’s expansion. Secondly it is used as an incentive token, and holders / stakers of the token will be prioritized in the release of new features or functions of the MYST platform. Thirdly, but not lastly, by staking MXST (in certain tiers) you will be able to increase your daily earnings by up to 1.5% depending on how much MXST you stake.
